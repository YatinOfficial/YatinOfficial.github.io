            <h3>Network Architectural Design and Implementation</h3>
            
            <p>
                A Network Architecture is a blueprint of the complete computer communication network, which provides a framework and technology foundation for designing, building and managing a communication network. It typically has a layered structure. Layering is a modern network design principle which divides the communication tasks into a number of smaller parts, each part accomplishing a particular sub-task and interacting with the other parts in a small number of well-defined ways. Layering allows the parts of a communication to be designed and tested without a combinatorial explosion of cases, keeping each design relatively simple. 
                The network architecture and design specialization will help you gain the technical leadership skills you need to design and implement high-quality networks that support business needs. You will learn how to design, maintain, and troubleshoot Internet, intranet, and extract connections, including local- and wide-area networks. This specialization will also build your knowledge of developing security and disaster recovery plans. Upon completion of this online degree, you will be well positioned to assume a senior management or team leader role in network management. 
                Integriti, with the team of well experienced players truly understands the functional and mandatory requirement of your need and thus provide you with prompt services to develop Network Architectural design and implementation.
